“Dublin, October 25, 1834.
‘⁴ My dear Newman,

“A most shocking report concerning yon has reached me,
which indeed carries such an improbability on the iace oi it that yon may
perhaps wonder at my giving it a thought; and at first Ι did not, but finding
it repeated lrom different qnarters, it seems to me worth contradicting ior
the sake ol your character. Some Oxiord undergraduates‚ Ι lind, openly
report that when Ι was at Oriel last spring you absented yourself from chapel
on purpose to avoid receiving the Communion along with me; and that you
yoursell declared this to be the case.

“I would not notice every idle rumour; but this has been so confidently
and so long asserted that it would be a satisfaction to me to be ableto declara
its falsity as a lact, from your authority. Ι did indeed at once declara my
utter unbelief ; but then this hae only the weight ol my opinion; though an
opinion resting I think on no insufficient grounds. Ι did not profess to rest
my diabolici on our long, intimate, and confidential lriendship, which would
make it your right and your duty· it I did any thing to oliend you or any
thing you might think materiallywrong—to remonstrate with me ;-but on
your general character3 which Ι was persuaded would have made you inca·
pablc. even had no such close connexion existed between us, oi conduct so
unchristian and inhumari. But, as I said, Ι should like ior your sake to be
able to contradict the report from your own authority.

‘⁴ Ever yours very truly,
“R. wilarium
