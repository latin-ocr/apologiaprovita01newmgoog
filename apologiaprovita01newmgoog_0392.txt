I think Ι must be iuoorreet in some rupea in supposing

¹ that the Saiut does not reeognizs a lie ss an injustius,

because the Cetea-,bisin of the CounciL as Ι hsve quoted it
at p. 281, says, “Vanitate et mendacio fides -ae veritus
tolluntur, arctissima vineuls societatis hwmanoe ; quibus
ι sublatis, sequitur summa vitas confusio, ut homalnsss nihil
a daemonilms differre videantwn¹¹

3. vaion ;-when, for instance, the speaker diverts
the attention of the hester to another subject 5 suggests an
irrelevant sset or makes a remark, whiah confusae him
and gives him somethingbo think about3 throws dust into
his eyesg states some truth, from which he is quite sure
his hearer will druw sn illogical und unu-ue conclusion,
and the like.

The greatest school of evasion, Ι speek seriously, is the
House of Commoris: sud necessarily so, from the nature
of the cese. And the hastings is another.

‘An instance is supplied in the history of St. Athana-
sius : he was in a. boat on the Nile, flying perseeution ; und
he found himself pursued. On this he ordered his men to
tiu-n his bost round, and mn right to meet the satellites of
J ulisn. They asked him, ⁸ Have you seen Athmsius?''
und he told his followers to answer, ‘¹ Yes, he is close bo
you.” They went on their mursa es if they were sure to
oome up to him, while he rau buck into Alexandria, and
there lay hid till the end of the perseeutiun.

I gave another insenum above, iu reference tu s doctrine
uf religion* The early Christianis did their best tomueeal
their Creed on scabunt οἱ the miscunceptions of the
heathen about it. Were the question usked of them,
‘¹ Do you worship s. Trinity ?'’ and did they enswer, ‘¹ We
worship one God, sud none else;¹' the inquil-er might, or
would, infer thet they did not acknowledge the Trinity of
Divine Perseus.

It is very difficule to druw the Line between these
