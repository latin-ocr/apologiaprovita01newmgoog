Posmos or m imm smus 1845. 275

If a uopy of Smwini, which speaks of equivomtion ss being
in s just muse sllowshle, be found in a student¹s room st
Osoott, not Scavini himself, but even the unhsppy student,
who has what aProtestantosllss bod book inhis possession,
isjudged to bs for life unworthy of credit. Are sll Pro-
testnnt text-books, which us used st ths University, 1111-
maculate? Is it necessary to take for gospel svery word
of Axistosse‘s Ethim, or every sssertion οἱ Hey or Burnett
on ths Anides? Are text-books the ultimsts authority.
or rather sre thoy not manusls in the hands of u leatursr,
and the groundwork of his remarks? But, again, let us
suppose, not the osso of s student, or of s professor, but ot
Semini himself, or of St. Affonmu now here again Ι ask,
since you would not sm-uple in holding Paley sor an honest
1111111, in spite of his dsfenee oi lying, why do you scrupis
st holding St. Alfonso honest? I sm perfeetly sure that
you would not seruple st Psley psmonslly ; you might not
sgrse with him, but you would not go fui-ther thsn to osll
him s bold thinker: then why should St. Alfonso's per-
son be odious to you, ss well ss his dont-rins?

Now Ῑ wish to tell you why you srs not afimid of Palsy3
bemuse, you would say, when ho sdvoeated lying, he was
taking emtreme or special cases. Yon would hove nn fem· of
a 1111111 who you knew had shot a burglar desd in his own
house, bsususe you know you ste not a burglar: so you
would not think that Psley hsd s habit of telling liss in
society, bet-‚ause in the (mse of s eruel alternative he
thought it the lasset svil to tell s lie. Then why do you
show such suspicion of a catholic theologiam, who speaks
οἱ certain extrmrdinsry ossas iu which sn equivoeation 111
a penitent cannot be visited by his oonfsssor as if it were a
sin? for this is the exact point of the question.

But agai-u, why does Paley, why does Jeremy Taylor,
when no praemit-al matter is actually before him, lsy down
a maxim sbout the lawfulness of lying, which will sua-ue
