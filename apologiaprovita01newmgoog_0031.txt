plne, they are even too numerous md varinus ω be unss—
nble ιι n moment for my purpose. Thau, ns ω the volum
which I have published, they would in many ways euno

in their composition, Ι have thought mne about them,
when they wem ouon out οἱ my hands, and for the most

their Luat proof sheetfl.

Under these circumstances my skeoeh will of eoum be
innomplete. I now for the fimt time oonoemplate my
murae aa a whole ; it is a first essay, but it will eone-uin,
Ι trust, no serious or substantia! miszake, and so fm- will

set nothing down in it ns aestain, of which 1 have not ,ι
clear memor-y, or some wn'ttan memorial, or the eor-robo-

of lnying stress on little things, of being beside the mark,
οἱ going into impertinent or ridieuloufl details, of sounding
my own pruine, of giving seandal3 but this is a mse above

¹others, in which I am bound to follow my own lights
