summer, when 1 received so serious a Μῦν to my ”alfis-
astiml views from the study of the Menophyuite wilm*
vex-ey. These mem eut into the original Movement at u
angle, fell anx-oss its line of thought, and then aet *hamt
turning that line' m its own direction They weromoet αἱ
them keenly religione men, with a true eoneern ὶσι· Μ
souls aa the fimt matter of au, with a great zen-l fur mn,
but giving little certainty at the time aa to whieh way they
would ultimately tum. Some in the event have remained
firm to Anglieanism, some have become Catholioe, md
some have found a refuge in Liberalism. Nothing was
clearer concerning them, than mat they needed to be kept
in orden and on me who had had sn muel· to do with the

because Ι was breaking up a compunt party, and some, as
a matter οἱ conscience, could not listen to me⁴ When 1
looked round for those whom 1 might consult in my diffi-
culties, I found the very hypothesis of those difficulties

me of the old sor-t, in end out of Oxford too, who were a
great help to me But on the other hand, though I neither
was so fond (with a few exceptione) of the persons, nor οὶ
the methods of thought, which belonged to this new school,
as of the old set, though Ι could not trust in their firmuees
of purpose, for, like a swarm of flies, they might coms and
go, and at length be divides] and dissipatecl, yet I had
an intense sympathy in their uhieet and in the directio„
