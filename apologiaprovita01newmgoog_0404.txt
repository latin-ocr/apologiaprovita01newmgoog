idle rumours to rest, and many unproiitable surmises; and yet all these
productioris represent but a portion of your labour, and that in the second
half of your period of public life.

“These works have been written in the midst of labour and cares of
another kind, and of which the world knows very little. I will speoify four
of these undertakings, each of a distinct character, and any one of which
would have made a reputation for untiring energy in the practical order.

“The first of these undertakings was the establishment of the congrega·
tion of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri-that great ornament and accession
to the foroe of English Catholicity. Both the London and the Birmihgham
Oratory must look to you as their founder and as the originator of their
characteristic exoessences: whilst that of Birmingham has never known
any other presidency.

“No sooner was this work fairly on foot than you were called by the
highest authority to commanos another, and one of yet greater magnitude
and difficulty, the founding ofaUniversity in Ireland. AftertheUniversities
had been lost to the Catholics of these kingdoms ior three oenturies, every
thing had to be begun from the beginning: the idea of such an institution
to be inculcated, the plan to be formed that would work, the resouroes to
be gathered, and the staff of superiore and professore to be brought together.
Your name was then the chief point of attraction whioh brought these ele
ments together. You alone know what difficulties you had to conciliate and
what to surmount, before the work reached that state oi consistenoy and
promise, which enabled you to return to those responsibilities in England

which you had never laid asida or suspended. And here, excuse me ifl
give expression to a fancy which passed through my mind.
“I was lately reading a poem, not long published, from the MSS. De

Rerum N ature, by Neokham‚ the foster-brother of Richard the Lien-haerted.
He quotes an old prophecy‚ attributed to Merlin, and with a sort of wonder,
as if recollecting that England owed so much of its literary learning to that
oountry; and the propheoy says that after long years Oxford will pass into
lreland-‘Vada boum suo tempore transibunt in Hiberniam' When I read
this, I could not but indulge the pleasant fancy that in the days when the
Dublin University shall arise in material splendour, an allusion to this
propheoy might form a poetic clement in the inscription on the pedestal of
the statue which commemoratos its first Rector.

“ The original plan of an Oratory did not contemplate any parochial work,
but you could not contemplate so many soulsin want of pastors without being
prompt and ready at the beck oi authority to strain all your efforts in coming

to their help. And this brings me to the third and the most continuous of
those labours to which Ι have alluded. The mission in Aloester Street, its

ohuroh and schools‚ were the first work of the Birmingham Oratory. After
several years of olose and hard work, and aoonsiderable call upon the private
resources of the Fathers who had established this congregation, it was de·
