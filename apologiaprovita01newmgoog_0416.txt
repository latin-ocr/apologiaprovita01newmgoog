“My dear Lord,

“ My absence from the Sacrament in the Collega Chapel on the
Sunday you were in Oxiord‚ was occasioned solely and altogether by my
having it on that day in St Mary’s; and Ι am pretty sure, iil may trust my
memory, that Ι did not even know oi your Grace's presence there, till aiter
the Servios. Most certainly such knowledge would not have affected my
attendance. 1 need not say, this being the case, that the report oi my
having made any statement on the subject is quite unfounded; indeed,
your letter ot this morning is the first information 1 have had in any shape
oi the existence oi the report.

“1 am happy in being thus ableto afford an explanation as satisfactory
to you, as the kind feelings which you have ever entertained towards me
could desire ;—yet, on honest reflection, Ι cannot conceal irom myeeli‚ that
it was generally a reliei tome, to see so little of your Gracc, when you were
at Oxiord : and it is a greater reliei now to have an opportunity oi saying so
to yourseli. Ι have ever wished to observe the rule, never to make a publio
charge against another behind his back, and, though in the course oi conver-
sation and the urgency of accidental occurrences it is sometimes difficult to
keep to it, yet Ι trust Ι have not broken it, especially in your own case : ie.
though my most intimate friends know how deeply I deplore the line oi
ecclesiastioal policy adopted under your archiepiscopal sanction, and though
in societyl may have clearly shown that Ihave an opinion one way rather than
the other, yet Ihave never in my intention, never (as Ι believe) at all, spoken
oi your Gracc in a serious way before strangers ;—indeed mixing very little
in general society, and not overapt to open myseli init, Ι have had little
temptation to do so. Least oi all should I so forget myseli asto take
undergraduates into my confidence in such a matter. ⁴

“ I wish Ι could convey to your Grace the mixed and very painiul feelings,
which the late history of the Irish Ohurch has raised in me 1-theunion oi
her members with men oi heterodox views‚ and the extinction (without
ecclesiastica] sanction) oi halt her Oandlestioks‚ the witnesses and guarantees
of the Truth and trustees oi the Covenant. Ι willingly own that both in my
secret judgment and my mode oi speaking concerning you to my friends,
Ι have had great alternatione and changes oi ieeling‚-deiending, then
blaming your policy, next praising your own seli and protesting against your
measures. according as the affectionate remembrances which I had oi you
rose against my utter aversion oi the secular and unbelieving policy in which
1 consideredthe lrish (lhurch to beimplicated. Itrust Ι shall never be ior·
getful oi the kindness yon unitormly showed me during your residence in
Oxiord: and anxiously hope that no duty to Christ and His Ohurch may ever ’
