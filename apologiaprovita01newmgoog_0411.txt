“ Preston, July 27, 1864
“ Very Rev. and Dear Sir,

“ It may seem, perhaps, that the Clergy ol Lancashire have been
slow to address you, but it would be incorrect to suppose that they have
been indifferent spectatore oi the conflict in which you bave been recently
engaged, This is the first opportunity that has presented itself, and they
glsdly avail themselves oi their annual meeting in Preston to tender to
you the united expression of their hesrtlelt sympathy and gratitudo.

“The atrocious imputation, out oi which the late controversy arose, was
ielt as a persona! affront by them, one and all, consciens as they were,
that it was mainly owing to your position as a distinguished Catholic ecclesi-
astic, that the charge was connected with your name.

“While they regret the pain yonmnst needs bavesuiiered, they cannot help
rejoicing that it bas ailorded you an opportunity oi rendering anew and most
importent service to their boly religion. Writers, who are not overscrupu-
lous about the truth themselves, have long used the charge ol untrnthinlness
as an ever ready weapon against the Catholic Clergy. Partly irom the ire·
quent repetition oi this charge, partly from aconsciousness that, instead oi
underveluing the truth, they have ever prized it above every earthly trea-
sure, partly, too, lrom the difficulty oi obtaining a hearing in their own de-
leuce, they hevegenerallypasseditbyinsilence. Theythankyoulorcoming
iorward as their champion: your own character required no vindication.
It was their battle more than your own that yon fought. They know and
feel how much pain ithae caused you to bring so prominently iorward your
own life and motives, but they now congratulata you on the completeness
ol your triumph, as admitted alike by friend and enemy.

‘¹ ln addition to answering the original accusation, you have placed them
under a new obligation, by giving to all, who read the English language, a
work which, ior literary ability and the lnoid exposition ol many difficult
and abstruse points. forms an inveluable contribution to our literature.

“They fervently pray that God may give you health and length oi days,
and, il it plesse Him, some other cause in which to use ior His glory the
great powers bestowed upon you.

ι’ Signed on behali oi the Meeting,

“THOS. PROVOST GOOKSON.
“The Very Rev. J. H. Newman.”
