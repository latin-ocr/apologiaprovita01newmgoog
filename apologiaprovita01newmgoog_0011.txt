impression to my disadvantage has rcsted on the
popular mind, as if my conduct towards the Angli-
can Ohurch, while l was a member of it, was incon-
sistent with Christian simplicity and uprightness.
An impression of this kind was almost unavoidable
under the circumstances of the case, when a man,
who had written strongly against a cause, and had
collected a party round him by virtue of such
writings, gradually faltered in his opposition to it,
unsaid his words, threw his own friends into per-
plexity and their proceedings into confusion, and
ondod ty passing over to the side of those whom
ho had so vigorously denounced. Sensitive then
aa l have over baon of the imputatione which have
boort so froaly cast upon me, Ι have never felt much
iniputiorioe urulcr them, as considering them to be
a portion of tho penalty which Ι naturally and
justly incurrod by iny change of religion, even
though thoy nraro to continue as long as Ι lived.
