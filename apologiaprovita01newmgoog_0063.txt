It wes, 1 suppose, to the Alexandrian school sud to the
early Chureh, that Ι owe in particular what I definitely
held sbout the Augels. Ι viswed them, not only us the

of the Visible World I eonsidered them es the real
nenses of motion, light, and life, and οἱ those elementary
principles of ths physieel universe, whinh, when offered in
their developments to our senses, suggest to us the noi-ion
of cause and effect, sud of whst sre eslled the lsws of
nature* This doctrine 1 heve drawn out in my Sermon
fur Minhselmss dsy, written in 1831. Ι say of the Angels,
“Every bresth of sir and ray of light end hest, every
beautiful prospect, is, es it were, the skirts of their ger-
menbs, the weving of the robes of those whose faves see
God.” Agein, I ask what would be the thoughts uf a

pebble, or s ray of light, which he treats ss something so
benenth him in ths sesle of existence, suddenly discovered
that he was in ths presence of some puwerful being who
wss hidden behind the visible things he wss iuspeoting,-—
who, though conceal-ing his wise haud, wss giving them
their beauty, grece, end pen-fection, ss being God’s insti-u>
ment for the purposessnay, whose robe and ornaments
those objeets were, whiuh he wss so esger to snslyze?’¹
and I therefore remark thst “ we msy ssy with grateful
