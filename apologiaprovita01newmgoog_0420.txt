“My dear Lord,

“The remarks contained in your last letter do not come
upon me by surprise, and I can only wish that Ι may be as able to explain
myself to you, as I do with a clear aud honest conscience to myself. Your
Grace will observo that the letter of mine from which you make an extract,
was written when Ι was in habits of intimacy with you, in which Ι have not
been oi late years. It troes not at all follow, because Ι could then spsak
iraely tc you, that Ι might at another time. Opportunity is the chiei thing
inauchanofficeasdeliveringtoasuperioranopinionabouthimseli. Thougb
I never concealed my opinion from you, Ihave never been forward. Ι have
spoken when place and time admitted, when my opinion was asked, whenl
was called to your side and was made your counsellor. No such favour·
able circumstances have beiallen me oi late ysara—iil must now stete
in explanation what in truth has never occurred to me in thiafaloess, till
now 1 am called to reflect upon my own conduct and to account ior an
apparent omission. 1 have spoken the first opportunity you have given
me; and Ι am persuaded good very seldom comes ol coluntcm'aq a

a measure that my opinions differed from your Grace¹s You knew it when
at Oxiord, ior you oiten found me differing from you. You must have ielt
it, at the time you leit Oxlord ior Dublin, You must have known it from
hearsayin consequence ol the book Ihave published. What indeed can
account ior my want oi opportunities to speak to you ireely my mind, but

that my views ars different irem yours?
¹‘ Aud that difference is certainly oi no recent date. ltacitly allude to it in

the very letter you quote-in which, 1 recollect well that the words ‘strange
office ior an instructor—to reip upon myaelf,' were intended to convey to you
that, much as I valued (aud still valuel your great kindness audthe advantage
oi your countenance to me at that time, yet even then Ι did not iall in with
the line oi opinions which you had adopted. Iu them Ι never acquiesced.
Doubtless Ι may have used at times sentimenta and expressions, which Ι
should not now use3 but 1 believe these had no root in my mind, and as
such they were mere idle words which Ι ought ever to be ashamed of, because
they were idle. But the opinions to which Ι especially alluded in my former
letter as associated by the world with your Grace's name under the title oi
‘Liberat' (but not, as you suppose, received by me on the world's authority)
are those which may be briefly described as the Anti-superstition notions;
and to these 1 do not recollect ever assenting. connected with these I would
