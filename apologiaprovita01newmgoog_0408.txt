“Very Rev. and Dear Sir,

“ The Academia oi Catholio Religion, at their meeting held
today, under the Presidency of the Oardinal Archbishop, have instructed ns
to write to you in their behali.

“ As they have learned, with great satisfaction‚ that it is your intention to
pnblish adefenceoi Catholic Veracity, which has been assailedin your person,
they are procluded irom esking you that that defence might be made by
word of mouth, and in London, as they would otherwise have done.

“ Gomposed, as the Academia is, mainly oi Laymen, they leel that it is not
out oi their province tc express their indignation that your opponent should
have chosen, while praising the Catholic Laity‚ to do so at the expense of the
Clergy, between whom and themselves, in this as in all other matters, there
existe a perfect identity oi principle and practice.

“It is because, in such a matter, your cause is the cause of all Gathohcs,
that we congratulate ourselves on the rashness oi the opponent that has
thrown the delence oi that cause into your hands.

“We romain,
“ Very Reverend and Dear Sir,
“Your very faithful Servantu,
