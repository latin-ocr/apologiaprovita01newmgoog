lie-THE DIOOESE OF BEVERLEY.

The following Address es is stated in the first pera-
grsph, comes from more than 70 Priests :—

“Hull. May 9, 1864.
“ Very Rev. and Dear Dr. Newman,

“ at a recent meeting of the olergy of the Diocese of
Beverley‚ held in Yorlr, at which upwards of seventy priests were present,
special attention was called to your correspondenoe with [a popular writer] ;
and such was the enthusiasm with which your name was received—such was
the admiration expressed of the dignity with which you had asserted the
claims of the Catholic Priesthood in England to be treated with becoming
oourtesy and respect—and such was the strong and all-pervading sense of the
invalnable service which you had thus rendered, not only to faith and morale,
but to good manners so far as regarded religious controversy in this country,
that I was requested, as Chairman, to become the voice of the meeting, and
to express to you as strongly and es earnestly us 1 could, how heartily the
whole of the olergy of this diocese desire to thank γοα for services to religion
as well-timed as they are in themselves above and beyond all commenda·
tion, services which the Catholios of England will never cease to hold in
most grateful remembrance. God, in His infinite wisdom and great mercy,
has raised you up to stand prominently forth in the glorious work of re-estab-
lishing in this country the holy faith which in good old times shed such lustre
upon it. We all lament that, in the order of nature, you have so few years
before you in which to fight against false teaching that good light in which
you have been so victoriously engaged of late. But our prayers are that you
may long be spared‚ and may possess to the last all your vigour‚ end all thet
zealfor the advancement of our holy faith, which imparts such a charm to
the productions of your pen.

“I esteem it a great honour and a great privilege to have been deputed,
as the representative of the olergy of the Diooese of Beverley. to tendor you
the fullest expression of our most grateful thsnks, and the assurance of our
prayers for your health and eterual happiness.

“I arn,
“ Very Rev. und Deer Sir,

“With sentiments of profound respect,
“ Yours most faithfully in Christ,

“M. TRAPPES.
“ The Very Rev. Dr. Newmen.”
