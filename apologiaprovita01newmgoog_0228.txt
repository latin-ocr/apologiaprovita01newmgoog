mure will be eniel on the subject of it presenely :—

“Nov. 22, 18⁴2 Ι only wieh chet your chum-h were
more known nmung ue by such writinga Yon will not
interest ue in her, tiu we see her, not in politiae, but in
her true functione of exhortiug, taching, eud guiding.
Ι viel! there were a ahanoe of making the leading men
among you undemtend, what 1 believe ie uo novel thought
ω ynunelf, lt ie not by learned discussions, or naute
arguments, ur repon-ts oi miracles, ehem the hem ol* Eug-
land mn be gained. It ie by men ‘approving themselvesj
like §.he Apoetle, ‘miniatem of Christ)

“As on your question, whether the Volume you heve
sent ie not calculated to remove my apprehensione thet
mother goepel ie substituted for the true oue in your
practiml instructions, before I ceu enswer ie in any way,
I ought m know how far the Sermone which it eomprieee
ere selected from e number, or whether they are the whole,
οι· euch ae &lle whole, which heve been publiehed of the
anthol-'el 1 nesure you, or at ἰωή Ι cruet, that, if it ie
ever clearly brought home to me thet Ι heve been wrong
in what I heve said on this subject, my public avowel of
that wuvietion will only be e. question ol* time wioeh me.

“1ss however, you eew our Church ee we eee it, you
would easily understand thet, euch e change of feeling, did
it take plane, would have no neeeeeery teudeuey, which
you seem vo expect, bo draw a pemon from the Chumh of
Englnnd ho theb of Rome. There is a divine life among
ue, clearly meuifeeted, in spite of ell our diem-dere, which
in m( grem. a note of the Ghurch, ae any nan be. Why
should we eeek our Lord’s presence elsewhere, when He
vousshsnfee ih to ue where we are Ζ What call heve we to
chugo our communion?
