of my old life—long prejudioes. In spite οὶ my ing-minet]
fem of Rome, and the decieion of my reason and wn-
seienoe ngninst her neeges, in spite of my affection for
Oxfotd And Oriel, yet Ι had e seut-et longing love οἱ Rome
the Mothsr of English Chriszianity, and I had a true devo-
tion Du the Elessed Virgin, in whose College Ι lived, whose
Altu- 1 sel-ved, and whose Immaculata Purity Ι had in one
uf my earliest printed Sex-mons made munh of. And it
was the eonsciousness of this bins in mynelf, if it in so to
be effled, which made me preanh so eamestly against the
danger of being swnyed in religione iuqujry by our sym-
pnthyrmher then by our resson And moreover, the
members of this new school looked up to me, as I have
said nnd did me true kindnesses, and really loved me, and
stood by me in trouble, when others went away, end for
ull this Ι was grstsful3 nsy, many οἱ them were in
trouble themselves, end in the same boat with me, and
thnt was e further muse of sympathy between us5 und
henne it was, when the new school emme on in force, and
into collision with the οΙιΙ, Ι had not the beart, any more
than the power, to repel bhem; I was in great perplexity,
and hardly knew where Ῑ Βωοᾱς Ι book their part; and,
when I wanoed ω be in peace and silence, Ι had to spenk
out, und I inem-red the charge uf weakness fmm nome
men, and of mysteriousnem, shuffling, and underhand
nie-ling from the majority.

Now Ι will say here frankly¹ that this sort of charge is a
matter which Ι cannot pmperly meet, because I cannot
duly realize it, Ι have never had any suspicion of my
own honesty3 and, when men say that Ι was djshonest, I
cannot grasp ‹zhe accusation es a distinet eoncepssion, such
ns it is possible to encounter. If e rnen said ω me, ⁴¹ On
such a day and before such perenne you mio evxx'mgwm
