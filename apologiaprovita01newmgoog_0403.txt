LE'l'I'ER OF APPROBATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE
BISHOP OF THE Dlocnsn OF BIRMINGHAM, DR. ULLA·
THORNE.

“ Bishop’s House, ι1111112, 1864.

“ My dear Dr. Newman,—

“ It was with warm gratification that, after the close ottho Synod
yesterday, I listened to the Address presented to you by the clergy 01 the
diocese, and to your impressive reply. But Ι should have been little

with your own thoughts than with the service of religion and the work ot the
Church. If we take no otherwork into consideration beyond the written pro·
ductions which your Catholic pen has given to the world, they are enough tor

the Lectures and Essays on University Subjects, and the two Volumes 01
Sermons3 not to speak ot your contributione to the Atlantis, which you
