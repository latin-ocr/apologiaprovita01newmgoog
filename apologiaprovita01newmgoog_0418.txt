that we may expect many to judge, aiter all, very harshly of those who do
differ from them: for, (lod help us! what will become of men if they receive
no more mercy than they show to each other! But at least, ii the rule
were observed‚ men would not condemn a brother on mere vague popular
rumours about principles (asin my case) ‘difficult to describe in lew words,’
and with which his ‘reputationis associated! My own reputation l know
is associated, to a very great degree, with what are in fact calumnious impu-
tatione, originated in exaggerated, distorted, or absolutely false statements,
ior which even those who circulate them, do not, ior the most part, pretend
