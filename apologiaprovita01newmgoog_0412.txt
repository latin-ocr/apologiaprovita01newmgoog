“Durham Sept. 22, 1864.
“ My Dear Dr. Newman,

“At the annual meeting of the Clergy oi the Dioceee of Hexham
and Neweastle‚ held a few days ago at Newcastle-upon-Tyne‚ Ι was commis·
sioned by them to express to you their sincere sympathy‚ on account of the
slanderous accusatione, to which you have been so unjustly exposed. We
ere fully aware that these foul calumnies were intended to injure the char·
aeter oi the whole body of the Catholic Clergy‚ and that your distinguished
name was singled out, in order that they might be more effectually propa-
gated. It is well that these poisonous shalts were thus aimed‚ as no one
could more triumphantly repel them. The ‘Apologia pro vite sut’ will.
il possible, render still more illustrious the name of its gifted author, and be
a laating monument ol the victory of truth, and the signal overthrow of an
arrogant and reckless assailant.

‘¹ It may appear late for us now to ask to join in your triumph, but as the
Annual Meeting ol the Northern Clergy does not take place till this time, it
is the first occasion offered us to present our united congratulatione, and to
declare to you, that by none of your brethren are you more esteemed and
venerated, than hy the Olergy ol the Diocese ol Hexham and Newcastle.

‘⁴ Wishing that Almighty God may prolong your lile many more years ior
the delence of our holy religion and the honour ol your brethren,

“I am, dear Dr. Newmun,

“ Yours sincerely in J esus Christ,
“RALPH PROVOST PLATT, V.G.

“ The Very Rev. J. H. Newman.”
