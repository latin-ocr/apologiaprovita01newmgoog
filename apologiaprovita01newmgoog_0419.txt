384 annrrrouaa roras,

warmest and most flattering terme, a much greater share in the forming of
your mind than I could preeume to claim, you bear a testimony, in which
ido most heartily concur, to thefreedom at least of our intercourse, and the
readiness and respect with which you were listened to. Your words are:
‘Much as I owe to Oriel in the way of mental improvement, to none, asI
think, do Ι owe so much as to yourseli. Ι know who it was first gave me
beart to look about me aiter my election, and taught me to think eorrectly,
and-strange office tor an instructor-to rely upon myself. Nor canI
terget that it hasbeen at your kind suggestion, that Ι have since been led
to employ myselt in the consideration oi several subjects. which I cannot
doubt have been very beneficial to my mind’

“Ilin all thiel waserroneous,—ii Ι have misled you, or any one else, into
‘the pride oi reason‚’ or any other kind oi pride-or ii I have entertained,
or led others into, any wrong opinione, Ι can only say Ι sineerely regret it
And again Ι rej0ioe if Ι have been the means of contributing to torm in any
one that ‘high religious temper and unelouded faith’ of which I not only
believe, with you, that they are able to withstand tendencies towards infi-
delity, but also, that without them, no correctness of abstract opinions is
worth much. But what Ι meant to point out, is, that there was plainly
nothing to preclude you from offering friendly admonition (when your view
ol my principles changed), with a tull confidence of being at least patiently
and kindly listened to.

“ Ι for my part could not bring myself to find relief in escaping the society
oi an old friend-with whothad been accustomedto frank discussion,-on
account of my differing from him as to certain principles, whether through
a change oi hie views, or (much more) oi my ewa-till at least Ι had made
iull trial of private and affectionate remonstranee and free discussion.
Even a ‘man thetis a heretic’ we are told, even a ruler oi a (lhurch is
not to reieot, till aiter repeated admonitione.

¹⁴ But though your regard ior me does not show itseli such asI think mine
would have been under similar circumstances, I will not therefore reiect
what remaine of it. Let us pray for each other that it may please God to
enlighten whichever oi us is, on any point, in error, and recall him to the
truth3 and that at any rate we may hold fast that charity, without which
all knowledge, and all saith, that could remove mountains. will profit us
nothing. 7

“ I tear you will read with a J'aundiced eye—ii you venture to read it at all
—any publication oi mine: but ‘ior auld lang syne’ I take advantage oi a
irank to enclose you my last two addresses to my clergy.

“ Very sineerely yours,
“RD. WHATnnr,’¹
