took of the liquor to Munich in order to subject it to a chemical analysis, and
declared then by writing the result of his researohes to be that he could
take it neither fornetural water, nor oil, snd that, in generabhe was not able
to explain the phenomenon as being in accordance with the lawa oi nature.

“Lot me add the testimony of ahistorioal authority. Mr. Sex, counsellor
of the government (K. Regierungsrath), in his history of the diocese and city
of Eichettidt, alter he has spoken oi the origin, the properties, and the effect
of the oil of St. Welburga. concludes that ⁴ they are of such a singular kind,
thet they not only exoeed far the province of extraordinary nature-pheno-
mena, but that they, in spite of the constent discrediting and slandering by
bullying free-thinkers, preserved the great confidence of the catholic people
even in far dietant countries.'

‘¹ Now oi the miracles. There are related by the people many thousands‚
but, oi course, lew oi them are attested. ln the Pastorel peperci nienstede,
1857, page wi, Ι read that Anton Ernest, Bishop oi Briinn, in Moravia‚
announces, under Nov. 1‚1857‚ to tlte Bishop oi Eichetadt, the recovery of a
girl in the establiehment of the sistere of oharity from blindness, and sends,
in order to attest the fect, the following document, which Ι am to translate
literally :—

¹⁴ ‘ In the name of the indivisible Trinity. We, Anton Ernest, by God's
and the Holy See’s grace, Bishop of Brunn. After we had received, first by
the curate of the establishment oi theDaughters ol Christian Obarity in this
place, and then also from other quarters, the notice that a girl in the aiore·
seidestabliehmenthad regeined the use of hereyes miraculously in the very
moment when she had a viel, containing oil ol St. Walburga‚ offered to her,
brought to her mouth and kiesed, we thought it to be our duty to research
scrupulouely into the fact. end to put it beyond all doubt in the way of a
special commission, by hearing oi witnesees and a trial at tbe place ol the
fact, il there be truth, and how much of it, in the supposed miraculous
healing.

¹¹ ¹ About the repon oi this commission and the adjoined testimony oi the
physician, we have then, as prescribes the Holy Council of Trent (Sese. 25),
collected the judgments of our theologians and other picus men: and as
these all were quite in acoordanoe, and the fact itself with all its circum-
stances lay before ua quite clear and open. we have, after invocation of as·
sistence of the Holy Ghoet. prononnced, judged. and decided as follows :—

‘¹ ⁴ The instantaneous removal of the most pertinacious eyelid-cramp
(Augenliedkrampf), which Matilda Makara during many months had hin·
dered in the use oi her eyes and kept in blindness, and the simultaneous
recurrence of the full eye-sight, phlogistic appearancee still remaining in the
eyes, which occurred when Matilda Makara on Nov. t, 1856, had a vial with
the oil of St. Walburga brought, full oi confidence, to her mouth end ln'ssed,
must be acknowledged to be a fact which, besides the order of nature, has
been eflected by God’a grace, and is therefore e miracle.
