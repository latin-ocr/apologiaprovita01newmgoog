in tha wrong⁴ 1 Iove, for inatanoe, the name of Origen:
I wnl not liatan to the notion that so great a aoul was lost;
but Ι am quite aum that, in the oonteat between hia doo-
trine and followem and the eeclesiastiml power, hia oppo-
nente were right, and he wa· wrong. Yet who ean speak
with patience of his enemy and the enemy of St. John
Clu-ysostom, that Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria? who
can admira οι· revere Pope Vigiliua Ζ And here another
wnaideration presente itself to my thoughts. In reading
eeclesiaetiml history, when I was an Anguem, it used to
be foroibly brought home to mo, how the initial error of
what afterwards became heresy was the urging for-ward
some truth against tha prohibition of authority at an un-
aeaaonable time„ There is a time for every thing, and
many a man desitas a reformati-an of an abuse, or the
fuller development of a doctrine, or the adoption of a
particular poliayy but forgets to ask himself whether the
right time for it is nome: and, knowing that there is no
one who will be doing any thing towards ita aeoomplish-
ment in his own lifetime unless he does it himself, he will
not liatan to the voioa of authority, and he spoils a good
work in hin own century, in order that another man, as
yet unbem, may not have the opportunity of bring-ing it
happily to perfectior] in the next* He may soem tn the
world to be nothing else than a bold champiou for the
truth and a martyr to free opinion, when he ia just one
of those persons whom the competent authority ought to
silanea; and, though the case may not fall within that
subject-matter in which that authority ia iufullible, or the
formal oonditions of the exercitae of that gift may be want-
ing, it ia clearly the duty of authority to act vigorously in
the onae. Yet its aet will go down to posterity as an
instance of a tyrannieal interfereuoe with private jutlg-
ment, and of the aileneing of a reformor, and of a boae
love of corruption or error3 and it will show still less ω
